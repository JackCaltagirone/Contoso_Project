# **Contoso Revenue Optimization & Profitability Analysis**  
*A Data Analytics Portfolio Project by Jack Caltagirone*

## **Overview**
This project analyzes the Contoso retail dataset to understand how the business generates revenue, where profit is created or lost, and which product and geographic segments drive overall performance. Using SQL and a structured analytical workflow, the project mirrors real-world business analysis: validating financial data, evaluating product performance, and uncovering opportunities to improve margins.

The goal is to demonstrate practical, job‑ready data analytics skills — not just writing SQL, but applying it to real business questions and communicating insights clearly.

## ** Financial Baseline & Profitability Analysis**
Validated order‑line financials by calculating revenue, cost, and profit, then classified transactions into margin bands to reveal profitability distribution. Expanded the analysis across product categories, subcategories, and countries to identify top‑performing segments and uncover structural patterns in margin behavior.

## **Cohort Behavior & State‑Level Customer Insights**
Built a full cohort framework to analyze customer purchasing behavior across states, segmenting users into acquisition‑year buckets and evaluating their long‑term value. Measured revenue, profit, and item volume per cohort, revealing a consistent pattern where older cohorts spend more and purchase more across all major U.S. states. Expanded the analysis to identify top categories and top products within each cohort, confirming structural demand patterns and highlighting Computers & Accessories as the dominant category across regions and generations.
