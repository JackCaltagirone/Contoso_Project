# Contoso Revenue Optimization & Cost‑Saving Analysis  
*A Data Analytics Portfolio Project by Jack Caltagirone*

## Overview
This project analyzes the Contoso retail dataset to identify where the business may be losing money and how profitability can be improved. Using SQL and a structured analytical approach, the project focuses on operational inefficiencies, product performance, customer behaviour, and regional trends — all grounded in the actual schema of the dataset.

The goal is to demonstrate practical data‑analysis skills that mirror real business scenarios: understanding costs, evaluating revenue drivers, and uncovering opportunities to reduce waste and improve margins.

## Project Goals
Based on the available tables and columns, this project focuses on:

### 1. Shipping & Operational Inefficiencies  
Using `unitprice`, `unitcost`, `netprice`, and `shippingcost` (if applicable), we identify:
- Orders with low or negative profit  
- High‑cost regions or stores  
- Products that are expensive to ship relative to their margin  

### 2. Product Profitability & Performance  
Using the `product` and `sales` tables, we analyze:
- High‑margin vs low‑margin products  
- Products with declining sales  
- Categories and subcategories that underperform  
- Cost vs price mismatches  

### 3. Customer Behaviour & Value  
Using the `customer` table, we explore:
- Customer demographics and purchasing patterns  
- High‑value vs low‑value customers  
- Geographic or demographic segments with low profitability  

### 4. Regional & Store‑Level Insights  
Using `store`, `customer`, and `sales`, we evaluate:
- Revenue and profit by region  
- Underperforming stores  
- Geographic areas with high operational cost  

### 5. Currency & Exchange Rate Impact  
Using `currencyexchange` and `sales.exchangerate`, we analyze:
- How exchange rates affect revenue  
- Which currencies or regions introduce volatility  
- Profitability after currency conversion  

## Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates the core capabilities expected from a data analyst:

- Understanding business problems, not just writing SQL  
- Working with real‑world retail data structures  
- Identifying operational inefficiencies and cost drivers  
- Turning raw data into actionable insights  
- Communicating findings clearly and professionally  

The analyses reflect realistic scenarios faced by analytics teams in retail, logistics, and finance.

## Tools & Techniques
- SQL (PostgreSQL)  
- Joins, aggregations, window functions  
- Profit and margin calculations  
- Geographic and demographic segmentation  
- Time‑based analysis using the `date` table
