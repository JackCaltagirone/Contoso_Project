# **Contoso Revenue Optimization & Profitability Analysis**  
*A Data Analytics Portfolio Project by Jack Caltagirone*

## **Overview**
This project analyzes the Contoso retail dataset to understand how the business generates revenue, where profit is created or lost, and which product and geographic segments drive overall performance. Using SQL and a structured analytical workflow, the project mirrors real-world business analysis: validating financial data, evaluating product performance, and uncovering opportunities to improve margins.

The goal is to demonstrate practical, job‑ready data analytics skills — not just writing SQL, but applying it to real business questions and communicating insights clearly.
