# Contoso Revenue Optimization & Cost‑Saving Analysis  
*A Data Analytics Portfolio Project by Jack Caltagirone*

## Overview
This project explores the Contoso retail dataset with one clear goal:

**Identify where the company is losing money — and uncover opportunities to save revenue, reduce waste, and improve profitability.**

Using SQL and analytical reasoning, I investigate real business problems such as customer retention, product performance, discount effectiveness, and operational inefficiencies. The project is designed to reflect the type of work done by data analysts in real companies.

## Project Goals
- Detect revenue leakage across discounts, returns, and operations  
- Understand customer behaviour over time using cohort analysis  
- Identify underperforming or low‑margin products  
- Evaluate regional and shipping inefficiencies  
- Provide data‑driven recommendations that improve profitability  

## Key Analyses

### 1. Revenue Leakage Analysis
Investigates:
- Excessive or ineffective discounting  
- High return rates  
- Orders where shipping cost exceeds profit  
- Customers who only buy when discounted  

Business value: Helps recover lost revenue and improve pricing strategy.

### 2. Customer Cohort Retention & Lifetime Value
Analyzes:
- When customers first purchased (cohort year)  
- How long they remain active  
- Revenue generated over time  
- Cohorts with strong or weak retention  

Business value: Supports retention strategy and long‑term forecasting.

### 3. Underperforming Product Analysis
Identifies products with:
- Low sales velocity  
- Declining year‑over‑year performance  
- Low margin contribution  

Business value: Helps reduce dead stock and optimize inventory.

### 4. Regional & Shipping Inefficiencies
Evaluates:
- Revenue by region  
- Shipping cost per order  
- Regions with high return rates  
- Unprofitable customer segments  

Business value: Improves logistics decisions and reduces operational waste.

### 5. Price Sensitivity & Optimization
Explores:
- Revenue vs price changes  
- Categories sensitive to price  
- Products priced too low or too high  

Business value: Supports margin improvement and pricing strategy.

## Tools & Techniques
- SQL (PostgreSQL)  
- Window functions  
- Cohort analysis  
- Revenue modeling  
- Segmentation  
- Data visualization  

## Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates the core skills expected from a data analyst:

- Turning raw data into meaningful insights  
- Understanding business problems, not just writing queries  
- Identifying opportunities to save money  
- Communicating findings clearly and professionally  

It shows the ability to think like an analyst — not just produce charts, but uncover insights that drive real business decisions.
